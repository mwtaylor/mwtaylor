Hi, I’m @mwtaylor

I'm currently learning about game development using Godot. Also interested in practicing creating pixel art. I've never considered myself much of an artist so I'm excited to take some time to develop a new skill.

Outside of software development I also am refining my skills as a cook by trying to make new recipes I've never made before.
